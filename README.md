## About this assignment

 Our goal has been examine how household energy usage varies over the period [2007-02-01, 2007-02-02], 
 by the reconstruction of the four plots given with this assignment instructions and using the base plotting system.
 
### Assumptions
 
    1. The dataset "Electric power consumption" has been downloaded to the active working directory and has been saved as "household_power_consumption.txt".
    
    2. Packages lubridate and chron has been installed.

### Notes
    1. We have been required to reconstruct Plot 4 saving it to a png file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
    
    2. The dimensions of the png file provided as example are width = 504 pixels and height = 504 pixels.
    
    3. This 32-bits depth example file has a transparent background that some PNG viewers render as black.


## Plots reconstructed
   The following four plots has been produced by the scripts stored here.
